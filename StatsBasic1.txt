Q1. What is Statistics?
=> It is science of collecting,analyzing the data for making better decision
Q2. Define the different types of statistics and give an example of when each type might be used.
=>2 Type of Statistics i) Descriptive =it consist of organizing and summarizing of data.

ii) Inferential =it consist of using data the you measure from a conclusion
Q3. What are the different types of data and how do they differ from each other? Provide an example of
each type of data.

=>Quantitative(Numerical):
i) Discrete: whole number e.g 1,2,3,45 etc
ii) Continuous : float number e.g height =6.2 feet, weight =59.5 kg etc

Qualitative( Categorical):
i)Nominal : which can have some range e.g Gender have range of M & F
ii)Ordinal: which can be rank e.g feedbackfrom customer  from 1 to 10 scale

Q4. Categorise the following datasets with respect to quantitative and qualitative data types:
(i) Grading in exam: A+, A, B+, B, C+, C, D, E => Ordinal
(ii) Colour of mangoes: yellow, green, orange, red =>Nominal(iii) Height data of a class: [178.9, 179, 179.5, 176, 177.2, 178.3, 175.8,...] =>Continuous(iv) Number of mangoes exported by a farm: [500, 600, 478, 672, ...] =>Discrete 

Q5. Explain the concept of levels of measurement and give an example of a variable for each level.
=>
i) Nominal Scale data : it's a Qualitative which hase some range & order does not matter into this e.g Gender (Male ,Femal)
ii)Ordinal Scale data: it's also Qualitative but into this ranking and order matter but it can not be measured difference because it not an numeric data
e.g  PHD ,BE,Master, Bachelor degree you can ranking it but you can't find the difference  in PHD and in a Bachelorsiii)Internal scale Data : Temperature measured in Celsius degrees.
iv)Ratio scale data: Weight measured in kilograms.

Q6. Why is it important to understand the level of measurement when analyzing data? Provide an
example to illustrate your answer.
=>for accurate data analysis as it determines the appropriate statistical methods and interpretations; for instance, treating nominal data as ordinal 
can lead to incorrect conclusions, such as ranking ethnicity 
categories as 'higher' or 'lower.

Q7. How nominal data type is different from ordinal data type.
=> Nominal: if it is forming a certain range in categorical data type then it's a Nomial 
=> Ordinal = if it's talk about ranking in categorical data hence it is ordinal data type

Q8. Which type of plot can be used to display data in terms of range?
=> Box plot 
because of Upper Fence and Lower Fence you can easily find out

Q9. Describe the difference between descriptive and inferential statistics. Give an example of each
type of statistics and explain how they are used.
=>
 i) Descriptive =it consist of organizing and summarizing of data.
it have measure of central tendency, measure of dispersion and graph such as Bar graph ,count plot ,etc
ii) Inferential =it consist of using data the you measure from a conclusion
it have Z-test, T_test, Hypothesis testing, etc

Q10. What are some common measures of central tendency and variability used in statistics? Explain
how each measure can be used to describe a dataset.

=mean =sum of data/count of data 
e.g = 1+2+3+4+5/5 = 3
