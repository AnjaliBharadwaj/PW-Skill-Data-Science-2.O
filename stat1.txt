
Q1. The three measures of central tendency are mean, median, and mode.

Q2. The mean is the average value of a dataset, calculated by adding up all the values and dividing by the number of values. The median is the middle value in a dataset when it is arranged in ascending or descending order. The mode is the value that appears most frequently in the dataset. These measures are used to describe the center or typical value of a dataset.

Q3. Measures of central tendency for the given height data:

Mean: 178,177,176,177,178.2,178,175,179,180,175,178.9,176.2,177,172.5,178,176.5/16

=177.01875

​
 
Median: Arrange the data in ascending order and find the middle value.
Mode: The value(s) that appear most frequently in the dataset.
Q4. To find the standard deviation for the given data, first calculate the mean of the dataset, then calculate the squared differences between each data point and the mean. Finally, find the square root of the average of these squared differences.

Q5. Measures of dispersion such as range, variance, and standard deviation are used to describe the spread or variability of a dataset. Range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values. Variance is the average of the squared differences between each data point and the mean. Standard deviation is the square root of the variance.

Q6. A Venn diagram is a graphical representation of the relationships between sets. It consists of overlapping circles or other shapes, with each circle representing a set and the overlapping areas representing intersections between sets.

Q7. For the given sets A = {2,3,4,5,6,7} and B = {0,2,6,8,10}:
(i) A ∩ B represents the intersection of sets A and B, which contains elements common to both sets. In this case, A ∩ B = {2, 6}.
(ii) A ⋃ B represents the union of sets A and B, which contains all elements from both sets without repetition. In this case, A ⋃ B = {0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10}.

Q8. Skewness in data refers to the asymmetry or lack of symmetry in the distribution of data. It indicates whether the data is concentrated more on one side of the mean than the other.

Q9. If a data is right skewed, the median will be less than the mean.

Q10. Covariance measures the extent to which two variables change together. It indicates the direction of the linear relationship between variables but does not give the strength of the relationship. Correlation, on the other hand, measures both the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables, standardized to a range between -1 and 1. Covariance and correlation are used in statistical analysis to understand the relationship between variables.

Q11. The formula for calculating the sample mean is:
Mean
=
Sum of all values
Number of values
Mean= 
Number of values
Sum of all values
​
 
For example, if you have the dataset {3, 5, 7, 11}, the mean would be:
Mean= 3+5+7+11/4
​ = 26/4
​
 =6.5

Q12. For a normal distribution, the mean, median, and mode are all equal.

Q13. Covariance measures the degree to which two variables vary together, while correlation measures the strength and direction of their linear relationship. Covariance is not standardized and its value depends on the scale of the variables, whereas correlation is standardized to a range between -1 and 1.

Q14. Outliers can significantly affect measures of central tendency and dispersion. For example, if you have a dataset of incomes where most values are around $50,000 per year but there's one extreme outlier of $10,000,000 per year, the mean would be skewed much higher than the typical income. Similarly, the standard deviation would be affected, as the presence of an outlier increases the variability of the dataset.
